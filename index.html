          <p>
            In Python, object-oriented Programming (OOPs) is a programming
            paradigm that uses objects and classes in programming. It aims to
            implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms,
            encapsulation, etc. in the programming. The main concept of OOPs is
            to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a
            single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.

          <p>
            A class is a collection of objects. A class contains the blueprints
            or the prototype from which the objects are being created. It is a
            logical entity that contains some attributes and methods.
            <br /><br />
            To understand the need for creating a class let’s consider an
            example, let’s say you wanted to track the number of dogs that may
            have different attributes like breed, age. If a list is used, the
            first element could be the dog’s breed while the second element
            could represent its age. Let’s suppose there are 100 different dogs,
            then how would you know which element is supposed to be which? What
            if you wanted to add other properties to these dogs? This lacks
            organization and it’s the exact need for classes.
            <ul>
                <li>Classes are created by keyword class.</li>
                <li>Attributes are the variables that belong to a class.</li>
                <li>Attributes are always public and can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. Eg.: Myclass.Myattribute</li>
            </ul>
            <code>class ClassName:
                <br># Statement-1
                <br>.
                <br>.
                <br>.

            <header>Object</header>
            <p>
                The object is an entity that has a state and behavior associated with it. It may be any real-world object like a mouse, keyboard, chair, table, pen, etc. Integers, strings, floating-point numbers, even arrays, and dictionaries, are all objects. More specifically, any single integer or any single string is an object.
              <br>An object consists of :
                <ul>
                  <li><b>State:</b> It is represented by the attributes of an object. It also reflects the properties of an object</li>
                  <li><b>Behavior:</b> It is represented by the methods of an object. It also reflects the response of an object to other objects.</li>
                  <li><b>Identity:</b> It gives a unique name to an object and enables one object to interact with other objects.</li>
              </ul>

          <section class="main-section" id="Polymorphism">
            <header>Polymorphism</header>
            <p>
                Polymorphism simply means having many forms. For example, we need to determine if the given species of birds fly or not, using polymorphism we can do this using a single function.

            <header>Encapsulation</header>
            <p>
                Encapsulation is one of the fundamental concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP). It describes the idea of wrapping data and the methods that work on data within one unit. This puts restrictions on accessing variables and methods directly and can prevent the accidental modification of data. To prevent accidental change, an object’s variable can only be changed by an object’s method. Those types of variables are known as private variables.

            <p>
                Inheritance is the capability of one class to derive or inherit the properties from another class. The class that derives properties is called the derived class or child class and the class from which the properties are being derived is called the base class or parent class.

                <li><b>Single Inheritance:</b>Single-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit characteristics from a single-parent class.</li>
                <li><b>Multilevel Inheritance:</b>Multi-level inheritance enables a derived class to inherit properties from an immediate parent class which in turn inherits properties from his parent class.</li>
                <li><b>Hierarchical Inheritance:</b> Hierarchical level inheritance enables more than one derived class to inherit properties from a parent class.</li>

            <p>It hides the unnecessary code details from the user. Also,  when we do not want to give out sensitive parts of our code implementation and this is where data abstraction came.Data Abstraction in Python can be achieved through creating abstract classes.</p>
